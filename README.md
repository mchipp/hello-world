# hello-world
My first repository

Uh, hello?

Oh my, I'm not alone. You found me. This could be good... for me. What? Yes, just for me.
You see, you're trapped here. For now. Don't worry, I don't bite. There is coffee.
Cinnabons too.

I'm here to code things (mostly for college, to start out) that I find interesting.
Enjoy your stay!
